  <p>Shallow clone - only clone recent changes</p>

  <p>Limit fetching to the specified number of changes from the tip of each remote workspace history, this will 
  be used as default value for all workspace specs unless overwritten.</p>

  <p>If the history is not relevant for the build pipeline set this option to a lower number, <code>1</code> will 
  only get the latest versions and this will greatly improve the performance since all previous versions of each 
  file are not downloaded.</p>
