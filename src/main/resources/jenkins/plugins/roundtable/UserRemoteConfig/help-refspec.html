<div>
    A refspec controls the remote workspaces to be retrieved and how they map to local workspaces. If left blank, it will default to
    the normal behaviour, which retrieves all the workspaces as <tt>REPOSITORYNAME/WORKSPACENAME</tt>.
    This default behaviour is OK for most cases.

    <p>
    In other words, the default refspec is "*:REPOSITORYNAME/*" where <tt>REPOSITORYNAME</tt> is the value
    you specify in the above "name of repository" textbox.

    <p>
    When do you want to modify this value? A good example is when you want to just retrieve one workspace. For example,
    <tt>master:origin/master</tt> would only retrieve the master workspace and nothing else.

    <p>
    Multiple refspecs can be entered by separating them with a space character.
    <tt>master:origin/master&nbsp;develop:origin/develop</tt>
    retrieves the master and the develop workspaces and nothing else.
