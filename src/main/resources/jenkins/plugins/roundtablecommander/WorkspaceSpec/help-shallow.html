<div>
  <p>Shallow clone - only clone recent changes</p>

  <p>Limit fetching to the specified number of changes from the tip of each remote workspace history.</p>

  <p>If the history is not relevant for the build pipeline set this option to a lower number, <code>1</code> will 
  only get the latest versions and this will greatly improve the performance since all previous versions of each 
  file are not downloaded.</p>
  
  <p>When a specific release is specified for the workspace no history is being downloaded, only the current version
  of the workspace at the time of the release.</p>
